Fundamental physics paper I began work on in early 2025 and originally published to arxiv on September 6. Hosted here for general reference and documentation. Interested parties can most easily contact patrickchristywork@gmail.com

The Shared Structure of GR and the Standard Model
Abstract: We propose a unified approach to fundamental physics based on POVMs giving rise to quantum geometry. With minimal ontic commitments we derive the Standard Model and GR by modeling these relations using higher-category theory.
We also derive the Born rule, Higgs mechanism, and explain the measurement problem.
